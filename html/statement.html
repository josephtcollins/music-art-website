      <p>This is a response.  A response to people, places, and things.  This is constantly put in front of my face, appearing and disappearing on a whim.  It comes into plain view every time I ride the subway, get a coffee, turn on the television.  Recently, after a less than unpleasant encounter, I decided I would make this exactly as I know it to be.  I have seen it many times, and in many different places, but I have never seen it as a tangible object of my reality.  So this is what I have produced.  I am sure there is a story behind this, rather than a sentence, or a snappy title.  Whether it be unresolved, or non-readable, this truly is an accurate replica of my fantastical response to some people, some places, and some things.  <em>2007</em></p>
